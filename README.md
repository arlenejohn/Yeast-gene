# Yeast-gene
Multi-label classification of yeast genes into 14 multi-label functional classes using binary relevance and classifier chain algorithms
The Yeast dataset is formed by micro-array expression data and phylogenetic profiles. There are different descriptive features per gene and each gene associated with a set of functional classes. There are 14 functional classes and a gene can be associated with any number of these.

We try to classify the genes into the functional classes the gene may or may not fall into using binary-relevance algorithm and a classifier-chain algorithm.
